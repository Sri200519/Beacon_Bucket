    "content": "OverviewTemporary Family Assistance is the name for the cash assistance program for basic and special needs which are paid to recipients of Jobs First. This replaced what was known as the AFDC program.Previous welfare programs provided little incentive to find employment as most earnings (after some small disregards) were deducted from the cash benefit. Recipients were not allowed to have or accumulate any savings to plan for future emergencies. Jobs First was designed to reward work by providing incentives to self-support. The program is intended to be transitional assistance and to supply individuals with the tools they need to become self-supporting within twenty-one months."
