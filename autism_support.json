        "content": "What is autism?Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism, is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions.These conditions are characterized by differences in communication and social interaction. People with ASD often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behavior.ASD is found in people around the world, regardless of race and ethnicity, culture, or economic background.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ASD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls. A study of 8-year-olds in 11 locations throughout the United States found a4.3-to-1, boy-to-girl ratioin 2016. About 1 in 54 of the study participants had ASD.There are indications that instances of autism are on the rise. Some attribute this increase to environmental factors. However, experts debate whether there’s an actual increase in cases or just more frequent diagnoses.Compare autism rates in different U.S. states."

        "content": "What are the symptoms of autism?Symptoms of ASD typically become clearly evident during early childhood, between ages 12 and 24 months. However, symptoms may also appearearlierorlater.Early symptoms may include a marked delay inlanguageor social development.The DSM-5 divides symptoms of ASD into two categories:problems with communication and social interactionrestricted or repetitive patterns of behavior or activitiesTo be diagnosed with autism, a person must experience symptoms in both of these categories.Problems with communication and social interactionASD can involve a range of issues withcommunication, many of which appear before age 5.Here’s a general timeline of what this might look like:From birth:trouble maintaining eye contactBy 9 months:not responding to their nameBy 9 months:not displaying facial expressions reflective of their emotions (like surprise or anger)By 12 months: not engaging in basic interactive games, like peek-a-boo or pat-a-cakeBy 12 months:not using (or only using a few) hand gestures, like hand-wavingBy 15 months:not sharing their interests with others (by showing someone a favorite toy, for example)By 18 months:not pointing or looking where others pointBy 24 months:not noticing when others appear sad or hurtBy 30 months:not engaging in “pretend play,” like caring for a baby doll or playing with figurinesBy 60 months of age:not playing turn-taking games, like duck-duck gooseAdditionally, autistic children might have trouble expressing their feelings or understanding those of others starting at 36 months.As they age, they might have difficulty talking or very limited speaking skills. Other autistic children might develop language skills at an uneven pace. If there’s a particular topic that’s very interesting to them, for example, they might develop a very strong vocabulary for talking about that one topic. But they might have difficulty communicating about other things.As autistic children begin talking, they might also talk in an unusual tone that can range from high-pitched and “sing-songy” to robotic or flat.They might also show signs ofhyperlexia, which involves reading beyond what’s expected of their age. Children on the autism spectrum might learn to read earlier than their neurotypical peers, sometimes as early as age 2. But they tend to not comprehend what they’re reading.While hyperlexia does not always accompany autism,researchsuggests nearly 84 percent of children with hyperlexia are on the spectrum.As they interact with others, autistic children might have difficulty sharing their emotions and interests with others or find it hard to maintain back-and-forth conversation. Nonverbal communication, like maintaining eye contact orbody language, might also remain difficult.These challenges with communication can persist throughout adulthood.Restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior or activitiesIn addition to the communication and social issues mentioned above, autism also includes symptoms related to body movements and behaviors.These can include:repetitive movements, like rocking, flapping their arms, spinning, or running back and forthlining objects, like toys, up in strict order and getting upset when that order is disturbedattachment to strict routines, like those around bedtime or getting to schoolrepeatingwords or phrases they hear someone say over and over againgetting upset over minor changesfocusing intently on parts of objects, like the wheel of a toy truck or the hair of a dollunusual reactions to sensory input, like sounds, smells, and tastesobsessive interestsexceptional abilities, like musical talent or memory capabilitiesOther characteristicsSome autistic people might experience additional symptoms, including:delayed movement, language, or cognitive skillsseizuresgastrointestinal symptoms, like constipation or diarrheaexcessive worry or stressunusual levels of fear (either higher or lower than expected)hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behaviorsunexpected emotional reactionsunusual eating habits or preferencesunusual sleep patternsWhat is stimming?“Stimming” is a term used to describe self-stimulating behaviors, often involving repetitive motions or speech.For example, someone might clap their hands, rub an object, or repeat a phrase. It’s typically associated with autistic people, but nearly everyone does some form of stimming, whether that’s rubbing their hands together or biting their nails.For autistic people, stimming can sometimes get in the way of daily life or cause physical harm. But it can also serve as a helpful coping mechanism for dealing withsensory overloador navigating uncomfortable situations, among other things.Learn more about stimming and how it shows up."

        "content": "What are the different types of autism?The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Clinicians use it to diagnose a variety of psychiatric disorders.The most recent fifth edition of the DSM was released in 2013. The DSM-5 currently recognizes five different ASD subtypes, or specifiers. They are:with or without accompanying intellectual impairmentwith or without accompanying language impairmentassociated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factorassociated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorderwithcatatoniaSomeone can receive a diagnosis of one or more specifiers.Before the DSM-5, autistic people may have received a diagnosis of:autistic disorderAsperger’s syndromepervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)childhood disintegrative disorderIt’s important to note that a person who received one of these earlier diagnoses has not lost their diagnosis and will not need to be reevaluated.According to the DSM-5, the broader diagnosis of ASD encompasses conditions such as Asperger’s syndrome.Learn more about Asperger’s syndrome and the other older classifications for autism."

However, that study has been debunked by other research and was eventuallyretractedin 2010.Read more about autism and its risk factors."

        "content": "What tests are used to diagnose autism?An ASD diagnosis involves:several screeningsgenetic testsevaluationsDevelopmental screeningsTheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)recommends that all children undergo ASD screening at ages 18 and 24 months.Screening can help identify ASD in children earlier than later. They may benefit from early diagnosis and support.TheModified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT)is a common screening tool many pediatric offices use. Parents fill out the 23-question survey. Pediatricians can then use the responses to help identify children who may have an increased chance of developing ASD.It’s important to note that screening is not a diagnosis. Children who screen positively for ASD do not necessarily have it. Additionally, screenings do not always identify every child who’s autistic.Other screenings and testsYour child’s physicianmay recommend a combination of tests for autism, including:DNA testing for genetic diseasesbehavioral evaluationvisualandaudiotests to rule out any issues with vision and hearing that aren’t related to ASDoccupational therapy screeningdevelopmental questionnaires, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2)Determining the diagnosisA team of specialists typically makes the diagnosis. This team may include:child psychologistsoccupational therapistsspeech and language pathologistsLearn more about the tests these specialists use to diagnose ASD."

A 4-year-old without autism may enjoy engaging in activities with other children. An autistic child may have trouble interacting with others or dislike it altogether.Autistic children may also engage in repetitive behaviors, havedifficulty sleeping, orcompulsively eat nonfood items. They may find it hard to thrive without a structured environment or consistent routine.If your child is autistic, you may have to work closely with their teachers to ensure they succeed in the classroom.Many resources are available to help autistic children as well as their loved ones. Local support groups can be found through the national nonprofit theAutism Society of America.Autism and exerciseAutistic children may find that certain exercises can help in easing frustrations and promoting overall well-being.Any type of exercise that your child enjoys can be beneficial. Walking and simply having fun on the playground are both ideal.Swimming and other in-water activities can serve as both exercise and asensory play activity. Sensory play activities can help autistic people who may have trouble processing signals from their senses.Sometimes contact sports can be difficult for autistic children. You can instead encourage other forms of challenging yet strengthening exercises.Get started with these tips on arm circles, star jumps, and other autism exercises for kids."

        "content": "How does autism affect girls?Because of its greater rate in boys, ASD is often stereotyped as a “boys’ disease.”According to a 2020 study of 11 regions throughout the United States, ASD is4.3 times more commonin 8-year-old boys than in 8-year-old girls. The research was based on data from 2016.A 2017 literature review concluded that the male-to-female ratio for autistic youth was actually closer to3 to 1.Either way, this does not mean that ASD doesn’t occur in girls. ASD may simply present differently in girls andin women.In comparison to recent decades, ASD is now being tested earlier and more often. This leads to higher reported rates in both boys and girls."

Thesesymptomsare also seen in some autistic people.Despite some similarities, ADHD is not considered a spectrum disorder. One major difference between the two is that people with ADHD do not tend to lack socio-communicative skills.If you think your child may behyperactive, talk with their doctor about possibleADHD testing. Getting a clear diagnosis is essential to ensure that your child is receiving the right support.It’s also possible for a person to have both autism and ADHD.Explore the relationship between autism and ADHD."
